To start the server locally, you can run the following command in your terminal:

node server.js

Assuming that this code is saved in a file named server.js in the current directory. This will start the server on the default port 8080 or the port specified in the environment variable PORT, if set. You can access the server at http://localhost:8080 in your browser or using a tool like cURL or Postman to make requests to the defined endpoints.
